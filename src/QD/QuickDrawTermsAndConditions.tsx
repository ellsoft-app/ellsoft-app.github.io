        translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The

        the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.

        You should be aware that there are certain things that EllSoft will not
        take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the
        app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi
        or provided by your mobile network provider, but EllSoft cannot take
        responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you
        don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your data
        allowance left.
      </p>{" "}
      <p></p>{" "}
      <p>
        If you're using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
        remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network
        provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
        mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
        while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app,
        you're accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming
        data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
        region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the
        bill payer for the device on which you're using the app, please be aware
        that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
        using the app.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        Along the same lines, EllSoft cannot always take responsibility for the
        way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays
        charged - if it runs out of battery and you can't turn it on to avail
        the Service, EllSoft cannot accept responsibility.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        With respect to EllSoft's responsibility for your use of the app, when
        you're using the app, it's important to bear in mind that although we
        endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
        rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
        it available to you. EllSoft accepts no liability for any loss, direct
        or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
        functionality of the app.
